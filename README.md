## Problem Statement
University events are essential for fostering community, encouraging engagement, and providing learning opportunities for students. However, existing methods for organizing and managing these events are often fragmented and inefficient, leading to:

- Limited awareness of events among students.
- Difficulty in managing RSVPs and waitlists.
- Poor communication of updates and reminders.
- Inefficiencies for event organizers in tracking and managing attendee data.

These challenges result in reduced participation, missed opportunities for students, and decreased overall impact of university events.
