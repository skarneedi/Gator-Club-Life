  - **'Invalid email or account not found'** for non-existent emails.
  - **'Incorrect password'** for wrong passwords.
- **Added email domain validation** to accept only **@ufl.edu** emails.
- **Updated the database** to remove non-UF emails and reset sequential user IDs for consistency.

---

## Announcements Component
- Redesigned the **Announcements section** for visual clarity and structure.
- Used card-based layout to display announcements cleanly.

  - **Application Submissions**
- **Features**:
  - A **search/filter interface** in the **My Permits** tab for better organization of submissions.

---

## Testing

In addition to the development of core features, we performed unit testing for various components to ensure they function correctly in isolation.

### Unit Testing:
- **Login Page**: Validated error handling and email validation.
- **Permits Component**: Verified form submission and event type selection.
- **Organization Details Page**: Ensured dynamic data loading worked as expected.
